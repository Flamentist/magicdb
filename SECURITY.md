# Security Policy

### Supported Versions

Magic DB is supported on Laravel 7.0 and above as well as PHP 7.2 and above.
This is as far as I can test, but it may work on older versions. 
However, this library is not meant to be used on older versions of Laravel and
PHP except on the versions mentioned above.
